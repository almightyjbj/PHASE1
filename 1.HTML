  <p><a href="https://atom.io/"target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Atom</a> is one of the most popular HTML editors in the market, and for good reasons. This open-source code editor aims to offer premium tools while keeping them completely free. In addition, it comes with open-source packages maintained by the GitHub community.
  Web developers can add, modify, and share various source code to improve Atom’s functionality.

  Although Atom doesn’t come with a visual editor, it offers a live preview of your webpage. Thus, you can spot errors easily and fix the code in the text editor.
  In addition to writing HTML code, Atom supports multiple programming languages, such as JavaScript, Node.js, and CSS. It’s also well-integrated with Teletype for easy project collaboration with other developers.</p>
